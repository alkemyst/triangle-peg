# Instructions

On a normal linux distro you just checkout the code, then go to the directory and then
```
make
```

This should produce an executable names ```findBestMove.exe``` with the following syntax:
```
Syntax: ./findBestMove.exe side_size marble_to_remove
```

Where ```side_size``` is the length of the triganle size and ```marble_to_remove``` is the id of the
marble to remove from the triangle.
